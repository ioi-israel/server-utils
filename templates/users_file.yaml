# Template for a users file.
# Each entry must contain: "username", "password", "first_name", "last_name".
#
# Optionally, "hidden" can be set to true in order to hide the user
# from scoreboards. The default is false.
# Similarly, "unrestricted" can be set in order to give the user
# unlimited submission access regardless of contest time.
